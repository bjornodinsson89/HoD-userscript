# HoD Faction Utility Script

## Overview
HoD is a simple browser tool designed specifically for members of the HoD faction in Torn City. It adds a handy overlay panel to your game screen, making it easier to stay organized and on top of faction activities. This is a private script meant only for HoD members—please don't share it outside the faction.

## What It Does
The script provides a pull-out tab on the side of your Torn City page. When you click it, an overlay opens with several useful sections:
- **Targets**: Keep a list of players you're tracking for attacks. Add IDs, see their status (like if they're in hospital or jail), life, and last activity. Refresh to update info.
- **War Targets**: Similar to Targets, but focused on war-related enemies. Helps during faction wars.
- **Chain Tracker**: Monitors your faction's chain progress, shows countdowns, and alerts you about timeouts or upcoming bonuses.
- **Members**: View your faction mates' details, like levels, online status, and positions.
- **Enemy**: Track enemy factions and their members, including war scores and alerts if many are online (possible push warning).
- **Errors**: A log of any issues the script encounters, with options to refresh or clear.
- **Settings**: Adjust alerts (e.g., chain thresholds) and manage your API key.

It's like having a quick dashboard for faction tasks, helping you coordinate better without leaving the game.

## Installation
1. Install Tampermonkey (browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
2. Get the script link from the faction forum, or ask me (BjornOdinsson89) for the user script.
3. Open the link in your browser—Tampermonkey will prompt you to install.
4. Enter your Torn API key when asked (needed for game data access).
5. Go back to the Torn webpage—the side tab should appear.

## Usage
- Click the tab to open/close the overlay.
- Switch sections using the menu at the top.
- Add targets or factions via the input fields.
- The script auto-refreshes some data in the background.

If something breaks, check the Errors section or ask in faction chat.

## Notes
- This is private for HoD members only—please dont share my code.
- Full access API key is needed, all information and keys are stored locally and does not communicate outside of Torn.com
- Updates: The script checks for new versions automatically. Install them when prompted.

If you have questions, ping BjornOdinsson89 in-game. Happy hunting!
